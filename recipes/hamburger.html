        <h2>Homemade Hamburger</h2>

            <p>A hamburger is a timeless favorite that brings together a juicy beef patty, fresh toppings,
                 and a soft, toasted bun for the perfect bite. Whether grilled, pan-seared, or 
                 flame-broiled, the patty is often seasoned simply to let its rich flavor shine. Classic 
                 toppings like lettuce, tomato, pickles, onions, cheese, and condiments like ketchup or 
                 mustard add layers of taste and texture. From backyard barbecues to diner menus, the 
                 hamburger is a delicious symbol of comfort food and casual dining at its best.</p>
