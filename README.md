In this lesson, I gained a solid understanding of the overall layout of a webpage, including how to structure content using HTML elements. I practiced using `<ul>` (unordered lists) and `<ol>` (ordered lists) to organize information clearly. I also learned how to add images to a page and link to other HTML files or external websites. Additionally, I got hands-on experience with Git, including making commits to track changes in my project. This helped me understand the importance of version control in web development.
