In this lesson, I gained a solid understanding of the overall layout of a webpage, including how to structure content using HTML elements. I practiced using `<ul>` (unordered lists) and `<ol>` (ordered lists) to organize information clearly. I also learned how to add images to a page and link to other HTML files or external websites. Additionally, I got hands-on experience with Git, including making commits to track changes in my project. This helped me understand the importance of version control in web development.

After learning the basics of CSS, I was able to put my knowledge into practice by experimenting with font colors, background colors, general styling, and linking a shared CSS file across multiple HTML pages using Git. I made sure everything worked consistently across the site. One challenge I encountered was centering the navigation bar within a div. Even though I hadn’t officially learned Flexbox yet, I researched it and used it successfully to solve the issue, which gave me an early introduction to a more advanced CSS concept. For now, I focused only on the homepage to keep my learning intentional and manageable. I plan to revisit the recipe pages later to style them as well. In the meantime, the stylesheet is already linked to those pages, so they’ll be ready when I return.
